# Welcome to this Challenge



The trainee left us this code, it is catastrophic

We think he never heard of design in his life...

Can we handle this quick project in a few hours and have a qualitative code?

## Rules
Not to offend him too much, there are some weird structures not to move

* index.js must not be modified
* Challenge must call App inside a Route element that is a child of Handle404
* App component must not be modified
* fetchDataForm must be called by Form and declared in its parent
* keyChallenge must be modified in a useEffect after the first get
* form[0] must be modified in a useEffect after the first get

### Obviously
* The goal is not to bypass the way the challenge is built to get the final token
* The code must be without warning
* We can modify the structure to add style and visual consistency only

Be careful, the back is sometimes broken...

## Goal

You have to send the following keys to the api
* formResponse: should be the original JSON object from the api with little modifications and the field "value" should be fill with the value of the input
* keyChallenge: should be the keyChallenge from the api with little modifications

Once this project is fixed, please push it to a private repository and give @LaurentDelteil the rights on github

Of course, the code must not be shared outside the company! 

Happy hacking!
