# Welcome to this Challenge




The trainee left us this code, it is catastrophic

We think he never heard of design in his life...

Can we take this quick project and have a qualitative code ?

## Rules
Not to offend him too much, there are some weird structures not to move

* index.js must not be modified
* Challenge must call App and App must not be modified
* fetchDataForm must be called by Form and declared in its parent
* keyChallenge must be modified in a useEffect after the first get
* form[0] must be modified in a useEffect after the first get

### Obviously
* The goal is not to bypass the way the challenge is built to get the final token
* The code must be without warning
* We can modify the structure to add style and visual consistency only

Be careful, the back is sometimes broken...

Once this project is fixed, please push it to a private repository and give @laurentdelteil and @lepadd the rights on github

Of course, the code must not be shared outside the company!
